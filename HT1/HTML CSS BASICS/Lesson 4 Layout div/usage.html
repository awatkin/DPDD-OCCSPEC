<h2> Current usages of BSD in industry</h2>

<p>BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) is a family of operating systems that have been influential in the development of modern computing. While it may not be as widely used as Linux or Windows, BSD continues to play a significant role in various domains. Apple, for instance, has a long history with BSD, dating back to the early days of macOS. The NeXTSTEP operating system, which was acquired by Apple and formed the basis of macOS, was heavily influenced by BSD. While macOS is not a direct BSD derivative, it incorporates many BSD components and concepts, such as the Mach kernel and BSD networking stack.</p>

<p>Nintendo, on the other hand, has adopted BSD for its Wii and Wii U consoles. These systems utilize a modified version of FreeBSD, which provides the underlying operating system framework. While the user interface and games are developed specifically for Nintendo's platforms, the BSD-based operating system handles core system functions and network communication.</p>

<p>Beyond Apple and Nintendo, BSD is used by various organizations and individuals for a wide range of purposes. Many network routers, firewalls, and storage systems are based on BSD, as it offers a robust and reliable platform for network infrastructure. Additionally, BSD is popular in the embedded systems and IoT (Internet of Things) markets, where its lightweight footprint and modular design make it suitable for resource-constrained devices.</p>

<p>In conclusion, BSD, despite not being as widely recognized as other operating systems, continues to be a significant force in the computing world. Its influence can be seen in the foundations of macOS, the operating systems of Nintendo consoles, and various network and embedded systems. As technology evolves, BSD is likely to remain a valuable component in the development of future systems.</p>
