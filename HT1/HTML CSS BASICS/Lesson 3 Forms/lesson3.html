<h2> HTML Forms</h2>

<p> You Need to build a form in this website.<br> You need to first declare the form with the "form" tag and closing "/form" tag. </p>

<p> After that, inside those "form" tags you then need to declare each of the types of "input" that can be used in a form</p>
<p> With each of the input types, I also want you to get used to using the "label" tag to label each input, this is the best way to do it
which is also the most compatible with accessibility tools. </p>

<P> you can find the input types here at this web link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp"> W3Schools Input options </a><br>
And you can find information on the "label" tags to use here: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_label.asp"> W3Schools Label tag</a></P>

<h3> Start your form below here!</h3>
</body> <!-- closes the body off, anything after this won't appear on the page, PAIRED TAG -->

</html> <!-- Closes of the html, PAIRED TAG -->
